            <h2>Our most controversial review!</h2>
            <h3>Rockstar are releasing on perfect time</h3>
            <p>It's important to note that the development of a game
                like GTA 6 involves a significant amount of time and 
                resources. While some fans may feel impatient for a new 
                installment, others understand that Rockstar's commitment 
                to quality and innovation often leads to longer development 
                cycles. Until an official announcement is made, opinions 
                on the timing of GTA 6's release may differ among players 
                and industry observers.
